# Telepathic Sparkle

## Sunset's new ability

The golden afternoon sunlight poured through the library windows of Twilight Sparkle's castle,
catching the swirling dust motes in its beams.
Twilight sat at her desk, quill levitating in her magical aura,
her nose buried deep in a thick volume titled *Arcane Connections: A Study of Mind and Magic*.
Spike, her ever-faithful dragon assistant,
lay in a beanbag chair nearby, idly munching on a bowl of emeralds.
Starlight Glimmer, Twilight's friend and former pupil,
was busy in the kitchen, preparing a batch of tea cakes.

The silence broke with a sudden *pop*.
A glowing book materialized on Twilight's desk---the enchanted journal
she used to communicate with Sunset Shimmer in the human world.

Twilight's eyes sparkled.
"A letter from Sunset!" she squealed,
causing Spike to drop a half-bitten emerald in surprise.
Starlight, hearing the commotion, went out of the kitchen
and poked her head in the library.

With a flick of magic, she opened the book and eagerly read the fresh message.
"Hey, Twilight!" it read. "You won't believe what just happened to me!"

Twilight leaned in, her heart skipping with curiosity.
Sunset's words flowed quickly, as if she could hardly wait to share.
"I think I've developed a new magic ability," Sunset wrote.
"I can read minds now. Well, kind of. Only if I touch someone."

Twilight blinked, rereading the sentence three times to make sure
she understood it correctly.
Her wings fluttered with anticipation as she grabbed a fresh quill.

"WHAT??" she scribbled back. "Tell me EVERYTHING."

Another *pop*, and Sunset's next message came fast and full of energy.
"It started a few days ago.
I was looking for Twilight---I mean, human Twilight---in a forest.
After I found her, I tried to convince her to come back to the camp.
When I touched her arm, I could directly see her thoughts!
At first, I thought is was some ephemeral magic, but it kept happening even after that day.
Every time I touched someone, their thoughts would pop into my head."

Twilight's mind raced. Mind reading magic was highly advanced and extremely rare.
Even Starswirl the Bearded had only theorized about it,
and nopony in living memory had ever mastered it.

Sunset's message continued.
"Then I touched human Pinkie Pie.
Oh, Twilight, her mind is a complete circus!
Imagine every random thought you've ever had happening at the same time,
with fireworks, musical notes, and dancing cupcakes."

Twilight giggled aloud, startling Spike, who was continuing munching on emeralds.
He glanced over in concern, but Twilight waved him off, too engrossed in the conversation.

She scribbled furiously, peppering Sunset with questions.
"Did you feel any magical surge when you got this ability?
Did you study any artifacts recently?
What exactly happens when you touch someone?
Do you feel a magical connection?"

Sunset replied thoughtfully.
"I'm not sure.
There wasn't any big magical explosion or anything.
Maybe it built up slowly?
I HAVE been practicing more magic lately,
and you know how weird the magic is over here."

Twilight tapped her chin with a hoof.
The human world did have unpredictable magical currents
as Equestrian magic was leaking into it.
Perhaps Sunset had stumbled onto something completely new.

An idea sparked in Twilight's mind.
She quickly wrote, "Describe the sensation when you touch someone.
Maybe I can replicate it."

Sunset's response was immediate.
"It feels like...
like the moment you open a book and the story pours into your mind all at once.
There's a warm tingle at the point of contact,
then a rush, like diving into a pool of thoughts."

Twilight sat back, her mind already whirring with possibilities.
If Sunset could do it by accident,
maybe she could figure out how to do it on purpose.

"Wow, you think it is possible to replicate such advanced mind magic?"
Starlight, after reading the conversation on the magic journal,
asked with a raised eyebrow.

"I am not sure, but I have to try!"
Twilight replied, her eyes sparkling with excitement.
"This could be a breakthrough in understanding how magic and minds work together.
Starlight, could you help me with the research?"

"Of course!" Starlight said enthusiastically,
her own curiosity as piqued as Twilight's.
"But just let me finish the tea cakes first."

## Research

For the next several days, Twilight and Starlight immersed themselves in research with a fervor.
Books were stacked in teetering towers around the castle library.
Scrolls littered every surface.
Charts and diagrams papered the walls like a mad scientist's lab.
Spike did his best to help,
but even he had to take snack breaks to survive the whirlwind of Twilight's study sessions.

They devoured every text they could find.
Ancient spellbooks, psychological studies,
even obscure scrolls from forgotten corners of the Canterlot Archives.
Slowly, patterns began to emerge.
A few old spells hinted at mind-linking magic,
though most involved dreams or shared memories, not real-time thought reading.

"How much I wish I could see Sunset
and how she does it with my own eyes," Starlight sighed,
her enthusiasm worn down a little by the exhaustion,
while her curiosity and determination grew stronger.

They experimented cautiously, trying to recreate the sensation Sunset had described.
Twilight crafted a focusing spell designed to tune her magic to the "frequency"
of another pony's mind,
and Starlight devised a way to use touch as the bridge of connecting
the magic and the subject.
Each attempt left them exhausted but more determined.
They started to feel that they were close.
Twilight could feel the magic thrumming just beyond her reach,
like a melody she almost remembered,
but she still could not quite grasp it.

Finally, after a particularly long night filled with failed attempts and muttered calculations,
They slumped over the desk.
Twilight groaned into her hooves,
and Starlight rubbed her eyes with heavy bags under.

"Maybe you just need a break,"
Spike padded over with two bubbling cups of apple cider.
"It's cider season now. Don't you want to try some?"

"Oh, Thank you, Spike," Starlight said, taking a cup and sipping it.
"I do think I need a break."

"I am sorry, Starlight," Twilight said.
"You have been working so hard for me. Please take a break.
Have a good night's sleep."

Starlight yawned and nodded,
"Don't be sorry, Twilight.
I am happy to help my friend, and I want to study mind magic myself anyway."
She stood up and walked toward the door.
"Don't you want to take a break too, Twilight?"

Twilight shook her head, her eyes still glued to the notes.
"No, I can't stop now. I feel so close. You go ahead and rest."

Starlight wanted to convince her to rest,
but she knew Twilight well enough to know it was pointless,
and she was too tired to argue.
"Okay, but don't stay up too late," she said, leaving the library.

In her way back to her room, Starlight's mind was still buzzing with thoughts of the day.
Random scenes and objects from recent days replayed in her head.

Mind magic, books, Twilight, Spike...

Desks, shelves, quills, the castle, the library...

Tea cakes, cider, the kitchen...

Suddenly, a thought struck her like a bolt of lightning,
making her stop in the hallway.
Her tiredness vanished in an instant but was replaced with the thrill of inspiration.

She rushed back to the library, bursting through the door.
"Twilight! I think I know what we're missing!"

Starlight's horn glowed,
and then a quill and a scroll, surrounded by lilac magical aura,
speedily floated toward her.
She jotted a quick note, the quill flying across the page.
"It's not just about tuning into another mind.
It's about *inviting* it to speak.
Like opening a door instead of smashing through."

Due to Starlight's infectious and abrupt enthusiasm, Twilight also perked up.
She looked at Starlight's notes and marveled at the insight.
"That's brilliant, Starlight! Let me quickly adjust the spell."

Twilight and Starlight went back to work with renewed energy.
They spent the next few hours refining the spell,
adding layers of complexity to the connection.
Finally, they felt ready for a test.

## First test

"Okay, I think we have it," Twilight was filled with optimistic anticipation.
"Instead of just trying to read someone's mind,
the spell creates a comfortable environment around the spellcaster for the subject's mind,
and then it opens up a channel for the mind to speak up for itself."

Spike blinked. "That sounds... less scary, at least."

Twilight smiled. "Exactly. Now, I need a volunteer."

Spike gulped and took a cautious step back.
His eyes innocently looked at Starlight, as if asking for help.

"No no, I need to stand by,"
Starlight sensed the sight on her.
"and set up protections and watch the test in case something goes wrong."

Spike gulped again at those words.
"Uh, how about we test it on a..."
His eyes darted around the library to look for other test subjects.
"On a chair, first?"

"Come on, Spike," Twilight coaxed, batting her eyelashes dramatically.
"It'll be completely safe! I promise!"

With a theatrical sigh, Spike rolled his eyes.
"Fine. But if my brain gets scrambled, you're making me extra gems for a week."

Twilight giggled. "Deal."

Twilight positioned Spike in the center of the room.
Starlight arranged a few protective wards around him just in case.
Spike looked nervously at the glowing circles on the floor.

"Is all this really necessary?" he asked, fidgeting with his claws.

Twilight adjusted a nearby rune with delicate precision.
"Probably not, but better safe than sorry.
If there's any unexpected magical feedback, the wards will absorb it.
Starlight will also be here to help us."

Spike frowned with concern. "That's not as reassuring as you think it is."

Twilight laughed softly.
"Relax. I'm not casting anything *at* you."

She steadied herself, inhaling slowly, letting her magic gather into a fine, delicate thread.
Her horn glowed, and she reached out, gently touching Spike's chest.

At first, there was nothing but the faint buzz of ambient magic.
Twilight pushed a little more energy into the contact,
inviting Spike's mind to brush against hers.

Suddenly, a rush of impressions flooded into her---vague but unmistakable.
She could sense Spike's mild irritation,
his nervousness, and, buried under it all, a deep affection and loyalty toward her.

Twilight gasped and jerked her hoof back, breaking the connection.
Spike stumbled, blinking rapidly.

"Whoa," he said, wobbling slightly. "That felt... weird."

"Did you do it?" Starlight asked with high hopes immediately after Twilight retreated her hoof.

"I did it! I actually connected!"
Scribbling notes at lightning speed, Twilight exclaimed.
"Spike, what were you thinking about just now?"

Spike scratched his head.
"I was thinking that if this messes up my brain, I'm gonna haunt you forever."

Twilight giggled, her wings fluttering with excitement.
"That matches what I sensed!
Nervousness, irritation, and... loyalty. Spike, Starlight, this is incredible!"

Spike grinned, a little sheepish.
"Aw, you know I'd never stay mad at you."

Twilight hugged him tightly.
"Thank you, Spike. You just helped make history."

Spike puffed out his chest.
"All in a day's work for your number one assistant."

Starlighted joined the hug.
"Great job, Spike! Great job, Twilight! We finally did it!"

Twilight paced in a circle, her mind racing with possibilities.
If she could read Spike's mind with a simple touch,
maybe she could explore deeper connections.
Maybe she could learn more about the very fabric of thought itself.

But first, there was something she could not resist.

She thought back to what Sunset had said about human Pinkie Pie's mind being a complete circus.
Now, with her newly mastered spell,
she had an opportunity she simply could not pass up.

She had to see the inner world of pony Pinkie Pie for herself.

## A glimpse into Pinkie's mind

The next morning, while Starlight was still asleep after days of hard work,
Twilight trotted eagerly to Sugarcube Corner.
The sweet scent of fresh-baked pastries filled the air,
and the cozy shop buzzed with activity.

Pinkie Pie was at the counter, noticing Twilight the moment the door swung open.
"Hi, Twilight!" Pinkie chirped.
"Are you here for a triple-fudge-cherry-caramel-crunch surprise?
Or maybe you're here to help me test my new Super-Duper-Special-Cupcake-Frostomatic 5000?"

"They all sound amazing!"
Twilight chuckled.
"But actually, Pinkie, I'm here for something a little... different."

Pinkie's ears perked up.
"Ooooh, different! I love different! What is it?
A game? A riddle? A treasure hunt?"

"Sort of," Twilight said, lowering her voice.
"Pinkie, I've developed a spell that lets me...
see inside somepony's mind."

Pinkie's eyes grew wide. "Whoa! Like, you can see
all the silly little thought balloons floating around inside my head?"

Twilight laughed. "Something like that.
Sunset Shimmer inspired me of this spell.
She also told me about what it was like to in human Pinkie's mind,
and it sounded so fascinating!
I was wondering... would you let me try it on you?"

Pinkie bounced in place, her excitement palpable.
"Of course! That sounds super-duper-fun!
I always wondered what it looks like in there myself!"

Twilight smiled warmly.
"Are you sure? It might feel a little weird."

"Twilight, weird is my middle name!"
Pinkie nodded so vigorously her mane wobbled like jelly.
"Well, actually, it's Diane, but you know what I mean!"

Twilight placed a gentle hoof on Pinkie's chest,
concentrating as she let the spell unfurl.

The world around her blurred and melted away.
A brilliant flash of pink light swallowed her vision.

When the glow faded, Twilight gasped.

She stood in a swirling, candy-colored landscape,
where the laws of physics seemed more like friendly suggestions.
Giant cupcakes floated lazily through a peppermint sky.
Rivers of chocolate flowed alongside grassy fields made of spun sugar.
Balloons bobbed and weaved like schools of fish,
and musical notes drifted on the breeze like dandelion fluff.

Creatures of every imaginable kind scampered across the landscape---dancing rubber chickens,
laughing clouds, hopping teacups.
The whole world pulsed with a wild, infectious joy.

Twilight's jaw dropped. "This... this is incredible."

Pinkie's inner world was a chaotic paradise,
a dreamscape where imagination reigned supreme.

Twilight wandered cautiously, marveling at the impossible sights.
A roller coaster looped overhead, its tracks made of licorice.
A herd of polka-dotted zebras galloped by,
laughing as they chased after a butterfly the size of a wagon.

But as Twilight ventured deeper, something changed.

The colors began to dim, fading from vibrant pastels to dull greys.
The air grew heavy, and the joyful music faltered into dissonant echoes.
The ground trembled underhoof.
Cracks spiderwebbed across the candy-cane trees.
The floating cupcakes began to sag and plummet like stones.

Twilight's heart raced. She could feel the world collapsing around her.
Panicked, she broke the connection, snapping back to the real world with a jolt.
The first thing she could see was
a Pinkie Pie swaying on her hooves, with her bright pink complexion slightly faded.

"Pinkie!" Twilight cried, rushing to steady her.
"Are you alright?"

Pinkie shook her head, blinking groggily.
"I feel kinda woozy... like I spun around too many times and then tried to do algebra."

Twilight helped her to a nearby chair, guilt gnawing at her.
"I'm so sorry, Pinkie. I didn't know it would hurt you," Twilight said, voice trembling.

Pinkie waved a hoof weakly.
"It's okay, Twilight. I wanted to help. I just... need a nap."

At this moment, a hurried Starlight rushed into the shop,
her mane still slightly damp from her morning shower.
"Twilight! I just saw your note. Why didn't you wake me up? How is it going?"
Then, she noticed Pinkie Pie slumped in the chair.
"Pinkie! What happened?"

Twilight sighed.
"Let's first help her into bed. I will explain in the process."

Starlight nodded.
She and Twilight carefully helped Pinkie into her bedroom upstairs and settled her into bed,
while Twilight recounted everything to Starlight.

They quietly stayed by Pinkie's side until she fell asleep,
their hearts heavy with worry.
Then, while Pinkie resting peacefully, they went out of Sugarcube Corner
and discussed the situation on their way back to the castle.

"I cannot think of a reasonable cause for this," Starlight shook her head.
"The test on Spike showed that the spell works just as theorized
and that it is totally safe. Why would it harm Pinkie?
If it was not the spell, it must be Pinkie that is special.
But there is a worse possibility: maybe it is Spike that is special.
After all, though the minds of dragons and ponies work alike,
there may be some latent differences between them that we are unaware of
to make them react differently to the spell.
We can easily test this by trying the spell on other ponies.
Twilight, how about you try it on me?"

"Nay way!" Twilight rejected the idea immediately.
"I already have Pinkie fall victim to my magic.
I am not going to risk hurting you too.
I will refrain from using the spell before I figure out the matter with Pinkie."

"Alright," Starlight shrugged.
"Then what about telling Sunset about this?
If telepathy-induced sickness is a common thing, she must've seen this."

Twilight affirmed this idea.
As soon as they returned to the castle, she took out the magical journal
and started writing to Sunset.

"Sunset, I saw inside Pinkie's mind."
Twilight wrote.

Before she was able to continue, a quick reply popped up.
"That's HUGE news! Congratulations! Was it as crazy as I pictured to you?"
Sunset's scribbles were dancing with excitement.

However, Sunset's high spirits did not infect Twilight,
who was still in deep worry of Pinkie's condition.
"It was indeed a crazy wonderland, but that's not important now."

Feeling the depression of Twilights words, Sunset's excitement faded
and was replaced with serious concern.
"What happened? Is everypony okay?"

Twilight took a deep breath and continued to tell Sunset about the incident.

"I have read several people's mind by now, but none of them got sick.
I'm afraid I can't give you a clue about Pinkie's condition."
After some moments, Sunset replied thoughtfully.
"Optimistically, maybe it was just a ephemeral effect of the spell,
and your bouncy friend will be back to her usual self after a good sleep."

Twilight sighed.
"This is the only option for now."

## The loss of Pinkie Sense

The next day, Twilight and Starlight returned to Sugarcube Corner first thing in the morning.
They found Pinkie Pie sitting at a table,
sipping a milkshake with a troubled expression.

"Morning, Pinkie," Twilight greeted carefully, approaching.

Pinkie smiled moderately. "Heya, Twilight, Starlight."

"Are you feeling better?" Twilight asked,
sensing the lack of Pinkie's usual exuberance.

Pinkie nodded slowly.
"Kinda. I don't feel sick anymore, but... something's weird."

Twilight's ears twitched in alarm. "Weird how?"

Pinkie tapped her chin thoughtfully.
"You know my Pinkie Sense?
The twitches, the tingles, the itches that tell me when stuff's gonna happen?"

Twilight nodded, but Starlight was confused.
"What is Pinkie Sense?"

Twilight said in surprise,
"You don't know Pinkie Sense?
Everypony in Ponyville know about Pinkie Sense.
It's Pinkie's special ability to predict something in the near future.
I will tell more about it to you later.
I still have the notes I took when I tried to scientifically explain it."
She remembered all too vividly the time she had spent trying, and failing,
to scientifically explain it.
After much skepticism, even Twilight had been forced to accept it was real.

"Well," Pinkie said, "it's gone. Poof! Like a popped balloon."
She gestured with her hooves while saying the words, mimicking a balloon bursting.

Twilight was startled. "Gone?"

Pinkie nodded again.
"I haven't had a single twitch since yesterday.
I even tried to provoke it!
I stood under a rickety ladder with a wobbly paint bucket balanced above my head, and nothing happened!
Usually I'd get an itchy nose or a twitchy tail before disaster struck,
but this time, splat!"
Pinkie pointed to a spot on her mane that was still faintly tinted blue.

Twilight's mind whirled.
Somehow, her spell must have disrupted whatever mysterious force powered Pinkie Sense.
She had never intended for that to happen.

"I'm so sorry, Pinkie," Twilight said, her voice tight with guilt.
"I'll fix this. I promise."

Pinkie smiled with a genuine but pale encouragement.
"I know you will, Twilight."

Determination burned in Twilight's chest.
She would not fail her friend.
Not again.

Back in the castle, Twilight threw herself into her research with a ferocity even more intense than before,
which even Spike found alarming.
For days, the library was a chaos of floating books,
scrawled notes, magical diagrams, and half-drunk cups of strong tea.
Starlight, just as worried as Twilight, joined her in the frantic search for answers.
They pored over everything they could find on mind magic, extrasensory abilities, and spiritual phenomena.
They also went through the old notes Twilight had taken during her previous studies of Pinkie Sense,
hoping to find some clue about how it might have interacted with the mind magic.

Twilight asked Spike to send urgent letters to the Celestia, Luna, and Cadence,
the other magically-talented princesses of the land,
but their replies turned out to have very limited help.
Starlight reached out to Sunburst, hoping her knowledgeable old friend to give some insights,
but he missed the letter because his mailbox was filled with spams from his mother.

Even when Starlight was sleeping,
Twilight still barely slept, her mind consumed with equations, theories, and dead ends.
Spike tried to help, but after being hit in the face with a particularly heavy tome titled
*The Comprehensive Guide to Esoteric Mental Energies, Volume III*,
he wisely retreated to the safety of the kitchen.

Worried that Twilight may wear herself out,
her friends dropped by occasionally to check on her,
but there was little they could do.
Even Fluttershy's gentle invitation to the animals' tea party
and Rarity's offers of spa days barely registered.

After five grueling days, Twilight fell asleep over her desk out of her exhaustion,
her mane frazzled and her eyes bloodshot.

She and Starlight could find nothing about how Pinkie Sense could be brought back.
Nothing even came close.
It was just like years ago,
when she could find nothing about how Pinkie Sense could come to be.

There was only one other source of wisdom she could think of.

## A second journey

Zecora's hut smelled of herbs and woodsmoke as always.
Twilight, with Starlight and Pinkie by her side, sat across from the striped shaman,
explaining the situation in a rapid-fire torrent of words.
Zecora listened patiently,
occasionally stirring a simmering cauldron with a wooden spoon.

When Twilight finally finished, panting slightly,
Zecora set the spoon aside and took a flaskful of dark liquid from the cauldron.
She then poured some of it on her hoof and rubbed it on Pinkie's cheek.
"Woo, itchy!" Pinkie reacted.

"Look!" After a while, Starlight saw a subtle change in the liquid.
"It is glowing!"

Amazed by the sight, Twilight leaned closer.
"Zecora, what does this mean?"

Zecora did not answer immediately but kept observing the glow.

After a long moment, she spoke, her voice rhythmic and calm.
"Not of this world, her power once came:
A spirit unseen, with no pony name.
To mend what is broken, tread paths unknown;
Face the heart hidden, not flesh nor bone."

Twilight blinked. "An unseen spirit?
You mean there's some kind of... being inside Pinkie?"

Zecora opened one eye and, with a knowing smile, added in a lilting chant,
"Answers you seek must come from within;
Trust not mere words, but where you have been."

Twilight bowed deeply. "Thank you, Zecora.
I think... I think I understand."

The three ponies waved a grateful goodbye to Zecora and started walking back toward Ponyville.
On their way, Twilight replayed Zecora's words in her mind.

An unseen spirit.

Pinkie's heart.

The world within.

As Twilight was reflecting on what she saw in Pinkie's mind
and what she learned from Zecora's words,
Twilight's heart skipped a beat.

She remembered something from her first trip into Pinkie's mind---a voice.
A strange, muffled whispering, hidden beneath the chaos.

At the time, she had dismissed it as just Pinkie's own subconscious mutterings.
But now...

Spike, when she read his mind, had no such hidden voice.

What if it had been something else? Something alive?

Twilight quickened her pace. She needed to try again.
She needed to face whatever it was that lurked in Pinkie's inner world.
"I think I know how to fix this," she said, her voice firm with determination.

Pinkie and Starlight exchanged glances.
"Twilight, I knew I could count on you!" Pinkie said, her eyes sparkling with hope.

"I need to go back inside your mind," Twilight said.

"Twilight!" Starlight exclaimed.
"Didn't you just say you won't use the spell again?"

Pinkie's face presented a mix of excitement and concern.
"You want to... go back inside my head?"
she said, biting her lip.

"I know it sounds risky," Twilight said,
"but I think there's something... someone inside.
If I can find them, maybe I can convince them to restore your Pinkie Sense."

Pinkie frowned in thought.
Then she gave a small, brave nod.
"Alright, Twilight. I trust you."

They quickened their pace and soon returned to the same cozy corner of Sugarcube Corner.
Pinkie settled into a comfortable chair, and Twilight sat opposite her.
Starlight stood nearby, nervously watching.

Once again, Twilight placed her hoof on Pinkie's chest and cast the spell.

The candy-colored dreamscape bloomed around her---but
it was weaker now, faded and cracked like an old painting.

Twilight moved quickly, ignoring the crumbling surroundings.
She focused, listening intently.

There---a whisper, just beyond hearing.

"Hello," Twilight called.
"I know you're here. Please, talk to me."

For a moment, there was only silence.

Then the sky darkened. Thunder rumbled. The ground shuddered.
A voice boomed around her, cold and furious.
*"You dare trespass again? I could destroy you, mind and soul."*

Twilight stood her ground.
"I mean no harm. I only want to help Pinkie."

The darkness writhed, but did not strike.

Slowly, the shadows coalesced into a blurry figure---vaguely pony-shaped,
but shifting and amorphous, like a living cloud.
It definitely was not anything like a physical being, but more like a spirit.

*"I am Keeny,"* the figure said with the same cold voice.
*"It was I who granted this vessel her gifts."*

Twilight's ears perked.
"You gave her the Pinkie Sense? And the... other abilities?"

The spirit that called themself Keeny shimmered with irritation.
*"In return for shelter within her boundless imagination,
I blessed her with talents beyond her kind.
But when you invaded, you endangered me.
I reclaimed what was mine to protect myself."*

Twilight bowed her head.
"I am truly sorry. I did not understand.
I swear, I will never intrude again."

Keeny regarded her for a long, tense moment.

At last, the spirit sighed, a sound like a wind through dry leaves.
*"Very well. For the sake of the vessel, I shall return what I have taken."*

The darkness began to lift. The colors brightened. The ground ceased its trembling.

Unable to tell what exactly happened,
Twilight felt herself being pulled back to the real world.

Pinkie opened her eyes and gasped.
"I feel... amazing!" she cried, bouncing up and down.

Starlight grinned, relief washing over her. "Pinkie, do you...?"

Pinkie tilted her head. "Twitcha-twitch!"

A flowerpot fell from a high shelf, missing Starlight by inches.
Pinkie caught it midair with a triumphant giggle.

Twilight laughed and hugged Pinkie tightly, tears pricking her eyes.
"You're back."

## Reflections

After the sentimental moment, Twilight told Pinkie and Starlight
what she saw in Pinkie's mind just then.
Pinkie listened quietly, then shrugged.

"I never knew about Keeny," she said.
"But now that you mention it, I do remember...
when I was a filly, after I got my cutie mark, everything just got... easier.
I could do things I never could before.
Like being everywhere at once! Or making a dozen cupcakes with one hoof!
Or knowing when my friends needed a smile."

Twilight marveled. "It all makes sense."

Despite the success, Twilight could not shake her curiosity about Keeny.
"What do you think Keeny is?"
On their way back to the castle, she asked Starlight,
after telling her all about what she saw in Pinkie's mind just then.

"I still can't believe Pinkie has always been haunted by a spirit,"
Starlight said, shaking her head.

"That does sound really weird if you put it *that* way," Twilight admitted,
"but I think Keeny is more like a guardian spirit.
They did give Pinkie very useful powers, after all."

"Why don't you ask Princess Luna?"
Starlight suggested.
"She must have walked in Pinkie's dreams numerous times.
She probably has met Keeny before if they really live in Pinkie's mind."

Twilight took the suggestion.
After they returned to the castle,
She asked Spike to write a letter to Princess Luna,
hoping that the guardian of dreams might know more.

In the cool quiet of the Canterlot gardens,
Luna read the letter carefully.
"I have visited Pinkie's dreams many times," Luna thought to herself,
"but never did I encounter such a spirit.
Suppose that the dream shares the same space as the inner world Twilight entered.
If Keeny exists and is very opposed to being visited,
they definitely don't welcome me in their territory.
Therefore, they would either attack me or hide from me.
Or, for another possiblity, they might be sleeping.
When Pinkie dreams, her mind may not be in a state to Keeny's liking,
and they may slumber in the depths of her mind instead."

Luna organized her thoughts and wrote a reply to Twilight.
Though the reply suggested several theories,
because Luna had not really noticed Keeny before,
she could not give any concrete answers.
In the end of the reply, Luna added that she might visit Pinkie's dream tonight
specially to check on Keeny.
Twilight was grateful for Luna's help and support.

Then, she wrote to Sunset Shimmer, recounting her second adventure to Pinkie's mind.
Sunset's reply came quickly, full of exclamation points and astonished scribbles.

"That's incredible, Twilight! A SPIRIT living in her imagination?
That explains so much---and also NOTHING!
I knew our Pinkie was wild, but I never thought your Pinkie had company in her head this whole time."

These opening remarks then sparked a long discussion about the inner worlds of human Pinkie and pony Pinkie.
They compared their experiences of navigating the inner minds of two Pinkies.

Human Pinkie's inner world, Sunset described, was a wild, uncharted landscape.
It was like a circus that never ended, brimming with chaotic energy, infinite balloon creatures,
reality-bending dream logic, and musical notes with no known composer.
It was not merely fun, but also overwhelming, a raw torrent of spontaneous and improvisational creation.

By contrast, when Twilight remembered pony Pinkie's mind---even with all its wildness---it now seemed...
dimmer, and calmer, in a strange, eerie way.
There had been structure, fewer creatures, and more empty space than she would have expected.
It was like a carnival that had once been larger but had pulled its tents inward,
a hush beneath the laughter.

Maybe, Twilight thought, Keeny had reshaped things.
They were a houseguest who rearranged the furniture to suit their needs, changing things unmaliciously.
Keeny had fed on Pinkie's imaginative energy, and in doing so, had unknowingly pruned it
and refined it into something more focused and more sustainable.

"It's like your Pinkie's creativity had a filter on it," Sunset wrote.
"Like it had been compressed into a manageable shape---still wild, but safer."

Twilight tapped her quill thoughtfully.
Had Keeny protected Pinkie from her own mind, or limited her, or both?
The mind, the only essential thing to any sentient being,
might be shaped not by upbringing or talent alone,
but by a silent passenger no one had even known was there.

Still, Twilight felt no bitterness. Keeny meant no harm but simply wanted to survive.
In return, Pinkie had been gifted with miraculous abilities that defied causality.
Twilight could not help but wonder:
what would Pinkie be like *without* Keeny?
If Keeny ever left, what would be lost, or gained?

She did not know.
She could not know.

## A dream

"Hahaha! Hahaha!"
Pinkie Pie bounced from one fluffy marshmallow cloud to the next, bursting out ringing laughter.
Every hop sent a musical note into the air,
forming little pastel rainbows that spiraled around her.
Below her, the grass was mint frosting, and the rivers ran with sparkling cider.
A carousel made entirely of gummy ponies spun in slow circles, playing a cheerful polka.
She zoomed down a licorice slide into a field of whipped cream and rolled over,
giggling, her hooves sticky and sweet.

Feet away, she spotted a familiar figure.
"Twilight!" She called out brightly, drastically waving her hooves.
"You're just in time! The grand confetti volcano is about to erupt!"

Twilight stood there at the edge of the frosted field, her expression unreadable.
"I can't stay, Pinkie," Twilight said.

Pinkie frowned disappointedly.
"Aww, why not? I made the frosting just for you! Triple sparkly!"

Twilight didn't answer.
She lifted a hoof and pointed toward the horizon.
Pinkie turned her head and gazed into the direction Twilight was pointing.

An indistinct pony-shaped figure stood there, part shadow, part light.
Thin tendrils of glowing mist trailed behind it like a cape made of night.

Pinkie gasped. Even though she had never seen it before, she knew who it was.
"Keeny?" She whispered, stared at the figure that matched
the appearance of Keeny that Twilight had described to her.

The creature floated toward them, silent, graceful, and otherworldly.
Around them, the rainbows dulled;
the grass withered; the river slowed; the carousel muted.

*"You promised to leave me alone,"* the spirit said, its voice echoing like a distant storm.
*"But you intruded again, so I shall not show mercy."*
Suddenly, without warning, they reached out a long, shimmering tendril and touched Twilight on the forehead.

There was no flash, nor scream.
Twilight simply collapsed and crumpled.

"No!" Pinkie shouted, her voice echoing thrice before fading.
She rushed to Twilight's side, shaking her, but Twilight did not move the slightest.
Her eyes were closed. Her colors had faded to gray.

Pinkie's hooves trembled, her tears uncontrollably spilling over.
"You killed her!" She cried toward Keeny.

Before Keeny said anything,
a cool breeze suddenly swept through the field.
From the shadows behind Pinkie, a familiar voice spoke consolingly,
"Fear not the fiction in your slumber, my subject.
Who dies in a dream does not actually leave."

Pinkie turned at the voice, and she saw
Princess Luna emerged from the shifting air with her mane trailing with stars.

"Princess Luna?" Pinkie sniffled. "Twilight's... she's..."

Luna approached the inanimate Twilight and touched her horn gently to hers.
A sparkle passed between the horns, and Twilight flickered and dissolved into mist,
melting back into the dream's fabric.

Pinkie gasped.

"She wasn't real," Luna said gently. "Not in the way you feared."

"Oh my, it's a dream!" Pinkie looked around and felt the world around her.
The weight of sadness was still clinging to her. "It *feels* so real!"
She peeked at Keeny, who was still floating nearby, watching with a strange intensity.
"Was... was that really... Keeny?"

Luna had the same question just a moment ago.
She sensed the commotion in Pinkie's dream
while watching over all that her subjects in Equestria were dreaming.
When she entered the dream and saw the figure much akin to what Twilight described Keeny to be,
she could not help but wonder if it was indeed the same spirit.
However, after a moment of sensing with her dream magic,
she could tell that it was merely a piece of Pinkie's imagination.

"No. It is the materialization of the image in your own mind," Luna said.
"It is your fear, your confusion, your guilt.
Dreams blend what is within and what is around.
This Keeny may not be the one who lives in you, but the one who *forms* in you."

Pinkie blinked. "So... I made her do that? In my dream?"

"Not quite," Luna said, "but your mind did
because it is still trying to understand what cannot be understood.
Grief, fear, curiosity---they weave the threads of dreams,
but truth comes only when you open your eyes."

Pinkie felt the dream starting to fade.
The rainbow collapsed; the carousel crumbled; the river ebbed.
Keeny, still hovering, gave one last flicker, and then melted into a shower of stars.

As Twilight's apparent death still ached in Pinkie's heart,
Luna leaned down and whispered,
"You are not alone, even when you dream."

## The end

Before dawn, Spike waked up with a start, feeling a warm flow from his throat.
"Belch!" Spike burped, a plume of green smoke erupting from his mouth,
and a scroll materialized in the air.

"Who sends a letter at this hour?"
Spike grumbled, rubbing his eyes.
He got up, grabbed the scroll, delivered it to Twilight's room, and waked her up.

Twilight unrolled it, finding that it was from Princess Luna.
In the letter, Luna stated that she failed to find Keeny in Pinkie's dream.

Outside the window, Ponyville twinkled under a starlit sky.
Somewhere, far away, a spirit named Keeny slept peacefully,
dreaming dreams spun from pink and laughter.
